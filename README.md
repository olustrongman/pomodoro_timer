# pomodoro_timer
This Application is a simplified version of Cirillo's original Pomodoro technique.

The Pomodoro technique is a time-management method that was developed in the late 1980s
by Francesco Cirillo. It involves using a timer to break down work into intervals, traditionally 25
minutes in length, separated by short breaks. Each interval is known as a pomodoro, which is
the Italian word for tomato. (Cirillo used a tomato-shaped kitchen timer when practicing this
technique as a university student.)

The Application is built using React.js and BootStrap for styling.
